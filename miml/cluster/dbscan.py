    '''
    Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise.
    
    DBSCAN finds a number of clusters starting from the estimated density
    distribution of corresponding nodes.
    
    DBSCAN requires two parameters: radius (i.e. neighborhood radius) and the
    number of minimum points required to form a cluster (minPts). It starts
    with an arbitrary starting point that has not been visited. This point's
    neighborhood is retrieved, and if it contains sufficient number of points,
    a cluster is started. Otherwise, the point is labeled as noise. Note that
    this point might later be found in a sufficiently sized radius-environment
    of a different point and hence be made part of a cluster.
    
    :param distance: (*string*) The distance.
    :param min_pts: (*int*) the minimum number of neighbors for a core data point.
    :param radius: (*float*) the neighborhood radius.
